# Hey, I'm Abdulqadir 👋

Frontend engineer building products that people actually use. I turn ideas into polished, functional web applications.

## What I Do

I specialize in building modern web applications with a focus on user experience and clean architecture. 
From rapid prototypes to production-ready systems, I ship code that works.

**Core Stack:**
- React, Next.js, TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS, modern CSS architecture
- RESTful APIs, GraphQL
- Git, CI/CD workflows

**Currently exploring:**
- Advanced React patterns and performance optimization
- System design for scalable frontends
- AI-powered applications

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, I'm thinking about product design, reading engineering blogs from companies shipping at scale, or figuring out how to make complex tools more accessible.

## Let's Connect

Working on something interesting? Building a product? Always open to collaborating with ambitious people solving real problems.
